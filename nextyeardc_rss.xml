  <item><title>Second Opinions on the 2026 Nats</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/SecondOpinionsonthe2026Nats.html</link><description>As the season draws to a close I figured it was time to take one last look at the young Nationals and make any updates to the status I assigned them in July (hitters and pitchers). Not everyone will appear here as I stand by most of what I said, here I will pause for a brief victory lap on Jose Ferrer, but a handful of players have either helped or hurt themselves enough to warrant a second opinion.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 11:15:55 EDT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Nats Bullpen Gives the Opposite of Shame</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/TheNatsBullpenGivestheOppositeofShame.html</link><description>The talk of the town for the last week has been the Washington Nationals bullpen and for once, it’s not because they’ve done something wrong. Like Bart Simpson when his dad became an astronaut, fans are feeling less shame when a reliever comes trotting out onto the mound. How did we get here?</description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2025 12:11:27 EDT</pubDate></item><item><title>What I Want to See From the Hokies</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/WhatIWanttoSeeFromtheHokies.html</link><description>It was another disappointing start to a Virginia Tech football season as Brent Pry fell to 1-3 in season openers with a 24-11 loss to #13 South Carolina. Despite the new coordinators and massive turnover on the field, it was a familiar feeling of the Hokies doing enough to hang around with a tough opponent but never really threatening to win. It’s always unfair to judge a team off of one game, especially if South Carolina proves they are actually a top 15 team, so here are some areas I’m focusing on in tomorrow’s game against Vanderbilt. </description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 12:05:04 EDT</pubDate></item><item><title>Regular Riley Adams</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/RegularRileyAdams.html</link><description>On June 27th Keibert Ruiz went on the 7-day IL with a concussion suffered from an unfortunate accident in the dugout, since then Riley Adams has started 34 of 50 games and put up a 114 wRC+. Naturally, this has a lot of people wondering whether Adams has been unleashed by the power of regular playing time. </description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:58:36 EDT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mitchell Parker Needs Help</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/MitchellParkerNeedsHelp.html</link><description>On the back of James Wood and MacKenzie Gore having a great weekend after their recent slumps Bluesky user kelseylobster requested that I do a similar post about Mitchell Parker. And since I am a strong subscriber to the principals of service journalism, I must obey. </description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 12:02:58 EDT</pubDate></item><item><title>What Davey Martinez Teaches Us About Brent Pry</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/WhatDaveyMartinezTeachesUsAboutBrentPry.html</link><description>We’re on the precipice of football season and I figured I would ease into it by writing something that is as much about baseball as it is about football. I know some of you are done with Davey Martinez content now that he’s fired, but I’m not ready to let go of it quite yet. I also think he’s a very illustrative example of the path Virginia Tech football head coach Brent Pry has followed through the end of last season and provides a hopeful contrast going forward.</description><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:22:02 EDT</pubDate></item><item><title>Slumps R Us</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/SlumpsRUs.html</link><description>Who would have thought that of the Nats Big Three core players CJ Abrams would be the only one not having a second half slump? If you’ve been tuned in to the Nats at all through the post-Davey/Rizzo era, and I wouldn’t blame you if you haven’t been, you’ve definitely noticed the troubles MacKenzie Gore and James Wood have had. If the Nats are going to have any hope for building a contender any time soon they’re going to need these two to figure things out fast.</description><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 03:16:30 EDT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Mystics Make a Deadline Decision</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/TheMysticsMakeaDeadlineDecision.html</link><description>Two weeks ago I was wondering how much we should be adjusting expectations for this year’s Washington Mystics squad based on their surprisingly good performance that put them on the edge of the playoffs instead of in the driver’s seat for a top draft pick. My conclusion is that despite the exciting youth-infusion, the Mystics did not have the firepower to truly compete. It seems like the front office agreed with me, because on Tuesday they traded All-Star guard Brittney Sykes to Seattle for veteran guard Alysha Clark and a first-round pick in the 2026 draft.</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 11:36:49 EDT</pubDate></item><item><title>Trade Deadline Roundup</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/TradeDeadlineRoundup.html</link><description>The trade deadline came and went yesterday and with MLB no longer allowing any sort of post-deadline waiver trade shenanigans that’s it for major changes to the Nats roster until the offseason. While the Nationals did not trade MacKenzie Gore they did make plenty of other trades that are worth at least a little exploration. </description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 11:50:00 EDT</pubDate></item>
  <item><title>Do Not Trade MacKenzie Gore</title><link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/DoNotTradeMacKenzieGore.html</link><description>The idea of a Gore trade seems to be more of a product of bored writers looking for patterns based off of three observations. First, that the Nationals are bad this season. Second, that Gore has the same amount of time until free agency as Juan Soto had when the Nats traded him. And third, that Gore has Scott Boras for an agent. Bingo bango, you have a situation that demands a trade.</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:03:26 EDT</pubDate></item><item>
    <title>Expectations for the Mystics Second Half</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/ExpectationsfortheMysticsSecondHalf.html</link>
    <description>The Washington Mystics, in a season that looked destined to be historically terrible, are holding onto the final playoff spot at 11-12, with just 2.5 games separating them from 4th place. As we enter the second half of the season how much should we be adjusting our expectations?</description>

    <title>Checking In on the 2026 Nats Pitchers</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/Checkinginonthe2026NatsPitchers.html</link>
    <description>Last Friday I did a run down of the young Nationals on the offensive side of the ball, breaking things down by their 2026 status based on their results so far. Now it’s the pitchers’ turn.</description>

    <description>The Washington Nationals just had their first draft without Mike Rizzo’s involvement since 2006 which had everyone looking for clues about the direction of the front office. </description>

    <title>Fire Davey Martinez</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/FireDaveyMartinez.html</link>
    <description>I've mentioned it on Twitter before that Davey Martinez has gotten a lot of undeserved cover from the popular memory of the Nats rebuild. This is his eighth season as manager and almost assuredly his sixth with a losing record.</description>

    <title>A Spin Through the Rotation</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/ASpinThroughtheRotation.html</link>
    <description>If you are like me, you also have probably found that when it comes to the Nats’ starting rotation there are some narratives in your head due to which games you happened to have caught, that are not entirely based in reality. So I decided to dive into the numbers to catch up on what’s really going on with the Nats starters.</description>

    <title>What's Next for CJ Abrams</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/What'sNextforCJAbrams.html</link>
    <description>If you’ve watched any Nats game this year you’ve probably noticed CJ Abrams. We’re 50 games into the season and he has 8 home runs, 9 steals, is batting .311 with a 160 wRC+.</description>

    <title>Optimism for a Struggling Core</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/OptimismforaStrugglingCore.html</link>
    <description>Just yesterday Baseball Prospectus announced new additions of their plate discipline metric SEAGER and their batted ball metrics including 90th percentile exit velocity were added to their leaderboards and player cards. To celebrate let’s take a look at two young players that are supposed to be establishing the Nats’ new core and instead find themselves mired in mediocrity: Dylan Crews and Luis García Jr.</description>

    <title>Clowns in the Bullpen</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/ClownsintheBullpen.html</link>
    <description>I admit this one got away from me. I started doing the research for this post last week in anticipation of posting it last Friday and then I dug deeper and dug deeper and next thing I know it’s another week later and I finally have a post. Luckily (?) the Nationals bullpen did not take advantage of my delay by suddenly being good.</description>

    <title>Should We Be Concerned About Dylan Crews</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/ShouldWeBeConcernedAboutDylanCrews.html</link>
    <description>I had started working on this post to hopefully find some small positives around Dylan Crews’ 0-18 with 10 strikeouts start to the season and instead what I found was a fractal of bad news.</description>

    <title>The Nats Played a Game Let's Overreact</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/TheNatsPlayedAGameLet'sOverreact.html</link>
    <description>With Mark Lerner still failing to scam Mayor Bowser into building a dome over Nats Park, the Nationals are taking their traditional day off after Opening Day which gives us plenty of time to let our imaginations run wild after one game. Here are four big thoughts after game 1 of 162.</description>

    <title>Analyzing My Bracket Hunches</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/AnalyzingMyBracketHunches.html</link>
    <description>As we are in the grips of March Madness and filling out brackets I figured it would be a fun time to breakdown the “rules”, in some cases more like advanced hunches, I’ve developed over the last 20 years of making picks and see if they’re actually useful or actively harmful. </description>

    <title>Ovechkin's Leadership Should Be Recognized More</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/Ovechkin'sLeadershipShouldBeRecognizedMore.html</link>
    <description>As Alexander Ovechkin closes in on the all-time goal scoring record a common refrain is that while he is undoubtedly the greatest goal scorer of all time, that’s pretty much all he is bringing to the table. Of course, that’s been a fairly common criticism ever since he donned a Washington Capitals uniform.</description>

    <title>Are The Nats Supposed to Be Good?</title>
    <link>https://nextyeardc.com/post/AreTheNatsSupposedtoBeGood.html</link>
    <description>I know the easy thing to do is say no and click away, but I implore you not to, because I am not asking the question from the perspective of cold hard facts.</description>
